# The slideshow for one of my statistics math assignment

Explore the custom slideshow. This was built solety as a supporting graphic infront of the game board in person and to satisfy some assignment criteria in a fun and inventive way...

... I was also too lazy to create a physical bristol board. So I spent far more time creating this site instead.

> This is the same project that utilized my [very pretty random direction generator!](https://github.com/the-kido/randomize)

### Have fun!
